# CIND820Project
Estimation of Obesity levels

# Data Files of the Project in CSV format
[**Original dataset file**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/Original_ObesityDataSet.csv) is a Original Obesity dataset obtained from [**UCI repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition) with Target variable.
[**Train dataset file**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/train.csv) is a training dataset obtained from Kaggle with Target variable.
[**Test dataset file**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/test.csv) is a testing dataset obtained from Kaggle without Target variable.

# EDA Files of the Project in HTML and Python 
* [**ObesityData_Report_train1.html**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/ObesityData_Report_train1.html) is the auto-generated EDA using Ydata Profiling for the Train dataset.
* [**ObesityData_Report_test1.html**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/ObesityData_Report_test1.html) is the auto-generated EDA using Ydata Profiling for the Test dataset.
* [**Original_ObesityData_Report.html**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/Original_ObesityData_Report.html) is the auto-generated EDA using Ydata Profiling for the Original dataset.
* [**EDA.ipynb**](https://github.com/Sandia-Kumari/CIND820Project/blob/main/EDA.ipynb) is the detailed exploratory data analysis done by me using python different libraries, it includes descriptive statistics and some inferential statistics like correlation Analysis (Pearson), ANOVA and Chi-square test. It also includes data cleaning/pre-processing.

# Research Objectives of this Projecet
1.	What type of classification models were used for estimation of multi-class problem obesity levels?
2.	How did each model perform in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC, and MCC?
3.	Which model had the best overall performance?
4.	What patterns do association rules uncover about the link between regular physical activity and maintaining a normal weight ?
5.	What behaviors or habits are most frequently linked to obesity type III
