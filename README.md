# CIND820Project
Estimation of Obesity levels
* **ObesityData_Report_train1.html** is the auto-generated EDA using Ydata Profiling for the train dataset
* **ObesityData_Report_test1.html** is the auto-generated EDA using Ydata Profiling for the test dataset
* **EDA.ipynb** is the detailed exploratory data analysis done by me using python different libraries, it includes descriptive statistics and some inferential statistics like correlation Analysis (Pearson), ANOVA and Chi-square test. It also includes data cleaning/pre-processing.

# Research Objective of this Projecet
 1)	Is it possible to make predictions by using the original dataset (2111 observations) for training and new dataset (20758) for testing the model?
     To answer this I will be using diverse classifiers including
   	* Logistic Regression
   	* Random Forest
    * Support Vector Machine
